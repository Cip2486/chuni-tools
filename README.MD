# Chunithm Tools

This project is a remake of [chuni_new_intl_viewer](https://github.com/Dogeon188/chuni_new_intl_viewer). The old project is deprecated, please don't mind those dirty codes.

This project is heavily inspired by [chuni_intl_viewer](https://github.com/kyroslee/chuni_intl_viewer) made by kyroslee.

The chart constant data is compiled from [chunirec](https://developer.chunirec.net/docs/v2.0/).
