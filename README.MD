## About this project

This project is a remake of [chuni_new_intl_viewer](https://github.com/Dogeon188/chuni_new_intl_viewer). The old project is deprecated, please don't mind those dirty codes.

This project is heavily inspired by [chuni_intl_viewer](https://github.com/kyroslee/chuni_intl_viewer) made by kyroslee.

The chart constant data is compiled from [chunirec](https://developer.chunirec.net/docs/v2.0/).

## Dev

To initialize the repository, copy the `./docs` folder and rename to `./build`. After that, use the following command to create a dev session:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

BTW, it's recommended to install Live Server plugin if you're using VSCode.

With the following command, you can build and compile the code to `./docs`, then GitHub Pages will handle the rest.

```sh
npm run build
```
